# Deep_learning101
The purpose of this repository will be to practice, enhance and experiment with the understanding of neural networks and it's implications. I'll be working along multiple sourcesto feed in codes and develop a working understanding of all the concepts. I'll be following various resources (Youtube, Research Paper, Podcast, Talking with the industry leaders)
